### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Over the past six months, I have embraced an exciting journey into the world of Full Stack Web Development.

This experience was an engaging mix of in-person lessons, engaging individual and group exercises, which allowed the creation of a solid base of skills in the field of web development.

I've had the pleasure of immersing myself in programming languages â€‹â€‹like Java and JavaScript, while building amazing user experiences using the React framework for the frontend.
In the backend, I made use of Eclipse to manage and create APIs combining PostgreSQL for database management.

This path has enriched my knowledge and passion for the world of web development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Exciting personal projects that challenge my web development skills and creativity.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Continuously improving my expertise in full-stack development, exploring new technologies, and staying updated with industry trends.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Open-source projects related to web development or any innovative project that aligns with my interests.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Enhancing my understanding of cloud services, serverless architecture, and containerization. Always open to learning and mentoring opportunities.
